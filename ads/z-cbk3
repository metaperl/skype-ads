A poor Polish woman immigrated to Hungary to work as a maid. The
house owner gave her a card and said: "Take this card and buy your
cleaning supplies with it. It will save you some money and when you
share it with others you will earn money."

... Fast forward 5 years ...

This woman now makes $15,000/month and has enough money to pay for her
child's education in the United States.

What was the one card that could end world misery. What was the one
card that allowed her to share her good fortune with others?
