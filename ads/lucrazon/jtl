Compensation Plan:



In Lucrazon Global we can participate passively or actively.


Passively:
10% of total daily revenue is shared among the entire sales force every day.

Purchasing one business unit ($1000) gives you your own Visa/MC/Discover/Amex merchant account and your own professional grade website/development/ shopping cart/inventory management with full customer support. It enters you into an extremely powerful passive income opportunity that can grow every day.


One business unit is $1000 ($2000 after Jan 1st) which generates ($500-$1000 per month)  minimum passively for providing 1 lead contact of a merchant service prospect to customer service sales every 90 days. It is not dependent upon the sale of the lead to get qualification credit, just provide a business lead.


Maximum of 15 positions can be purchased (bank wire, money order, or cash deposit). Initial position is the Merchant Account and must be purchased with a debit card.  The additional 14 units are optional and can boost your passive income by a factor of 15 times daily as 15 profit centers are set up to receive daily revenue sharing.

Units can be purchased via a debit or credit card, Bank Wire, or CASH DEPOSIT into the company bank account! (Chase or B of A)


Minimum passive income on 15 units could be $6,700-$11k per month:
Conservative estimate: 15 units X 30 days X $15 daily= $6,700 per month.
Liberal estimate: 15 units X 30 days X $25 daily= $11,200 per month.


Estimated projections for 12 months passive participation. (Not including the additional income from the merchant portfolio sales):


        1 unit $1000): $4,400 profit. ($800 after 20% commission)

        3 units ($3000): $13,200 profit ($2400 after 20% commission

        7 units ($7000): $30,800 profit ($5600 after 20% commission

        15 units ($15,000): $66,000 profit ($12,000 after 20%)



â€¢ *MERCHANT ACCOUNT PORTFOLIO SALES* Receive passive income from the portfolio sales to the banks that occur each time the company has gathered 10,000 merchant accounts from the sales team. (estimated 90 days or less) These portfolio sales will generate a return of 10 to 50 million dollars that is then shared (30%) with all the Lucrazon business owners. (that's us!)



Each 60-90 days, the top 20 team leaders who collectively enroll 500+ merchants via their entire business network will receive approximately $450,000 or more if just one of their Merchant Accounts is included in that portfolio sale. Accomplish that 3 times a year and your rocking it!


Business owners are able to process all the purchases through their Lucrazon merchant account and save 30% as well as earn passive income on the 50% of the profit margin on transaction fees.

20% Commission on direct sales. That's $200 made for each $1000 business enrollment.


3% Passive commission on indirect sales from entire business network 5 tiers deep every day!That could be hundreds or thousands of indirect network businesses adding to your daily income.


6% Two Channel Unit Bonus(Binary Bonus). Earn 6% from your business network income once your right and left business channels are balanced.

Active Income

The active income opportunity is to offer Credit Card processing to any business merchant for 30% less than the competition. Lucrazon is able to offer the lowest rate because they are the level 1 payment processor and own their own gateway thus have eliminated all the additional fees by offering all the services direct to the merchant. For every transaction that occurs in any business online/offline you receive 50% of the profit margin on each transaction fee of every single swipe that business does.  (Profit after Visa/MC/Discover/Amex get their 1.6+/-%) Major passive income!
