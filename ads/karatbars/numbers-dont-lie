(*) NUMBERS DONT LIE. Let's look at the PRICE OF GOLD (*)

(*) year 2000 =  $300/oz
(*) year 2006 =  $600/oz
(*) year 2010 = $1100/oz
(*) year 2013 = $1700/oz

I wish I had bought gold in 2000. But no more wishing.
I buy gold in small affordable quantities every month
and I invite you to do the same! www.GoldenArk.tv
