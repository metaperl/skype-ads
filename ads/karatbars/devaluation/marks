In 1919, you could buy an ounce of gold for 170 Marks. Just 4 years later, the price was 87 TRILLION Marks.

All currencies/cash have devaluated to zero over time. The dollar and euro appear to be to the same currency graveyard, based on their steady loss in buying power.

Gold is inflation proof. Where do you want your holdings when the dollar loses value just like the Mark and every other currency has historically.

Having a good savings plan makes sense. Having a savings plan that pays you a full time income when you refer others is even better.
