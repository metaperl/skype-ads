(*) In 1936, an ounce of gold was $34.87. You could buy a 3-piece suit, a tank of gas and a concert for 2 and dinner for 2.
(*) In 2013, an ounce of gold is $1300. And you have enough dollars to buy all the same things.

Gold has held its purchasing power. It's inflation-proof. How much of that can you get for $35.00 now? You can't even fill your gas tank for that!
