In 1971, a loaf of bread was 25 cents, gas cost 35 cents per gallon
and gold was 35.00 an ounce.

In 2013, bread costs $2.50 per loaf. Gas costs 3.50 per gallon and
gold is 1200.00 an ounce.

So over 40 years, bread and gas cost 10 times more. Gold costs 40
times more. So we see that the US dollar purchases 10 times less and that gold purchases 40 times more.
