WORDS FOR THE WEEK: Nothing worthwhile really ever comes easily.  Work, continuous work and hard work, is the only way you will accomplish results that last.  Whatever you want in life, you must give up something to get it.  The greater the value, the greater the sacrifice required of you.

Have you paid yourself first this week and shown others how to do so also?
