          When you build a program you want several things.

\o/ REAL WEALTH - you want to own something of real lasting value
\o/ CUSTOMERS   - the bedrock of most businesses is a loyal customer base
\o/ PAY PLAN    - $300,000 within 12 months is entirely feasible. All you have to do is have it in your mind to find 2 people who are committed to (a) save in REAL WEALTH (b) duplicate the finding of 2
