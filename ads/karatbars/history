"History always repeats itself. When a civilzation debases its currency supply, all that currency will once again come chasing that same tiny little pile of metal, and gold and silver will revalue themselves measured in those currencies. This will happen to the United States, just as it did to every empire in history. Thos who recognize this stand to become wealthy beyond belief."
