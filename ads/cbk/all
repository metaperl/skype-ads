\o/ All their downlines will be falling in.... \o/

The big players for the last 3 decades - Amway, Mona Vie, Melaleuca, Avon, Mary Kay... the top 10 earners in MLM usually come from these companies.

Imagine this: they look at the top earners list and they are displaced. All the top spots are this company from Eastern Europe they never heard of. And their earnings are WAY bigger than theirs and they only took a year or 2 to do it?!

Then they wonder: "what is their product? who are their customers?"

Then they realize: "OH MY GOD. It all products. In all countries. And no one would not want to be a member. I've been in many of these stores HUNDREDS of times and never received these benefits... and so has my whole downline!"

Next step: they immediately sign up their entire 6,000 person organization. And that's just one big player. At least 50 big players are going to do the same thing once they see the power of a single FREE membership.

I'm glad I joined a year ago and I cant wait for all those downlines to fall behind me!
