________ I have 5 simple questions _________

1 - Do you want to support domestic and international education initiatives?

2 - Do you want to support projects which sustain the environment and/or
develop renewable energy solutions?

3 - Do you want to save money and perhaps make money on 90% of the
purchases you must make or want to make within a month? In-store and online, all around the world?

4 - Do you own a local business (or know someone who does) and want to offer a rewards program that truly addresses the customer-merchant tension?

5 - Do you want to form an international business in a 10-year old European company with physical offices in 44 nations that does everything described in questions 1-4?

If you answered "YES!" \o/ to any of the above, please contact me privately!
