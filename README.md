Advertise in Skype Chats

# Usage

## Scan for the chat you want to advertise in

    $ scan.py

You will find a listing for your skype advertising room like this:

    skypename: #someuser/$b3691abf8f26222 topic: "UNLIMITED AD" friendly name: "UNLTD AD"

The `skypename` is the name that Skype uses for the room and that is what you need.

# Optional

You may find [boxes by Thomas Jensen](http://boxes.thomasjensen.com/) to
be of use in creating ads
